<p>Ayurveda is being practiced in India since the 
Vedic times for the well-being of the people. It is one of the 
oldest systems of Medicinal science that is used even today. 
Being used extensively in medicine, proper identification of the 
appropriate medicinal plants used for the manufacture of 
medicine is very important in Ayurvedic medicinal industry. 
Identification of the appropriate medicinal plants is usually 
done by the skilled practitioners who have achieved expertise 
in this field. The knowledge of identifying these medicinal 
plants is being passed from generation to generation. 
However, as the identification is completely based on human 
perception, there can be scope for error or misjudgment.  
Incorrect or substituted raw materials make the medicine 
ineffective. It can even result in certain side-effects too. This 
makes it necessary for an efficient system to be developed that 
can properly identify the Ayurvedic plant based on the leaf 
samples. </p>
